# Assignment2 - My Portfolio

## Description

As an employee, I created a portfolio to be viewed by my employer with samples of my work so it can be reviewed for the open position I'm applying to.

## Demo

The photo below is an example of what they'd like my portfolio to include.

## The Creation

I created this repository which includes an index.html file, assets folder with images and my style.css to develop my portfolio.

First, I created the wireframe and design elements I wanted present in my portfolio (ie. fonts, colours, content, links, photos). Next, I added the content to my index file. Once my HTML was complete, I put together the CSS styles I needed to recreate the wireframe I had designed. Finally I applied the CSS styles to my HTML code which created the portfolio seen in the links below.
